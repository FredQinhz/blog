7. Describing Architecture
8. Microservice Architecture *

## Software Architecture in General

1. What is software architecture?
   - Structure, Elements, Relationships, Design
2. What does a software architect do?
   - Liaison, Software engineering Tech, knowledge, Risk mgmt
3. Where do architectures come from?
   - NFRs, ASRs, Quality Requirements; Stakeholders, Organizations, Technical Environments...
4. Architecture (4+1)Views
   - Logical view, Process view, Physical view, Development view + Use case scenarios...
5. Architectural activities and process
6. Software architecture knowledge areas

## Architecture Process

## Quality Attributes

1. Software Requirements
   1. Functional requirements, Quality requirements (NFRs), Constraints
2. Quality Attributes
   1. Internal vs. External Attributes
   2. Modeling quality attribute scenarios: Source, Stimulus, Artefact, Environment, Response, Measure
   3. Availability, Interoperability, Modifiability, Performance, Security, Testability, Usability, X-ablility...
   4. Tactics for quality attributes
3. Architecturally Significant Requirements
   1. How to gather and identify ASRs: Requirements, Interviews, Business goals, Utility tree

## Architecture Patterns

1. Architecture Patterns
   1. Context, Problem, Solution: elements + relations + constraints
2. Module Patterns
   1. Layered pattern (micro-kernal pattern)
3. Component-Connector Patterns
   1. Broker pattern, Model-view-controller pattern, Pipe-and-filter pattern, Client-server pattern, Peer-to-peer pattern,Service-oriented pattern, Publish-subscribe pattern, Share-data pattern
4. Allocation Patterns
   1. Map-reduce pattern, Multi-tier pattern
5. Patterns vs. Tactics

## Designing Architecture

1. General Design Strategy
   1. Abstraction, Decomposition, Divide & conquer, Generation and test, Iteration, Reuse
2. Categories of design decisions
   1. Responsibilities, Coordination, Data, Resources, elements mapping, Binding time, Technology
3. Attribute-Driven Design (ADD 2.0)
   1. Inputs to and outputs of ADD
   2. 8-step process: 1. confirm requirements, 2. choose an element to decompose, 3. identify ASRs, 4. choose a design satisfying ASRs, 5. instantiate elements & allocate responsibilities, 6. define interface, 7. verify & refine requirements, 8. repeat step 2-7 until all ASRs satisfied
   3. Step 4: 4.1 identify concerns, 4.2 list alternatives, 4.3 select patterns/tactics, 4.4 determine relations, 4.5 capture views, 4.6 resolve inconsistencies

## Documenting Architecture

Views and Beyond

1. Views:
   1. Styles (viewpoints), patterns and views
   2. Structural views: module views, component-and-connector views, allocation views
   3. Quality views
2. Documenting views: 1. build stakeholder/view table, 2. combine views, 3. prioritise & stage
3. Beyond views: documentation info & architecture info (mapping between views)
4. Documentation : views + beyond

## Evaluating Architecture

ATAM: Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method

1. Stakeholders involved in ATAM
2. Inputs to and outputs of ATAM
3. Phase 0: Partnership & preparation
4. Phase 1: Evaluation - 1
   1. present ATAM
   2. present business drivers
   3. present architecture
   4. identify architectural approaches
   5. generate utility tree
   6. analyse architectural approaches
5. Phase 2: Evaluation - 2
   1. present ATAM & results
   2. brainstorm & prioritize
   3. analyse architectural approaches
   4. present results
6. Phase 3: Follow-up

## Final Exam
